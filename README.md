# Savonius-Turbine
Framework for Metaheuristic optimization of Savonius Turbine and Cylindrical Deflector system using Kriging Surrogate Model and Grey Wolf algorithm.


URANS simulations have carried out using Ansys Fluent 2022 R1 for training the Kriging surrogate model. The trained surrogate model is then utilized by the Grey wolf algorithm to optimize the geometric parameters of the system, i.e., the deflector's x and y position and the deflector's diameter.
